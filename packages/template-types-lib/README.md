Template-level configuration (for instantiating a new project) like a new deno project or a new rust project.
If very framework-specific like spring boot or a nextjs turborepo we can have instead of a project type with the language template we have a specific template for project type and project feature 1 to 1 for example spring boot template and spring boot project type.

Project Type configuration (for framework-specific code) like fastapi, django, springboot, etc.

Project Feature configuration (for optional project features) like database, auth, etc. like alembic/sqlalchemy for a fastapi project

Feature configuration (for optional features specific to the corresponding project feature) for example, a new entity for an alembic/sqlalchemy project feature (incorporate AI)

File-level configuration (for individual file templating) like a react component, a python class, etc. (incorporate AI)
