Use these short guides to install Skaff, run your first template, and learn the core ideas that power every workflow:

- [CLI quickstart](./getting-started/cli-quickstart) — install the binary, register template sources, and scaffold a sample project.
- [Web quickstart](./getting-started/web-quickstart) — launch the Next.js interface with Docker or from source and generate a project from the browser.
- [Core concepts](./getting-started/core-concepts) — understand templates, stored settings, and how diffs keep generated projects upgradeable.

Each page is designed to be skimmable and links back to deeper CLI, web, and template authoring topics when you are ready.
