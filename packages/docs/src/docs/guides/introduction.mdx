Skaff is a TypeScript-powered scaffolding toolkit that turns curated templates
into ready-to-run projects. It combines a CLI, a web dashboard, and shared
libraries so teams can ship consistent services without copying stale
boilerplates.

## What you get

- **Guided project creation.** Render templates from the CLI or web UI, validate
  answers with Zod, and review a Git diff before anything touches your
  repository.
- **Repeatable upgrades.** Save template settings once and rerun the template
  later to generate patch files that capture only upstream changes.
- **Composable features.** Break large starters into subtemplates so optional
  modules, jobs, or stacks can be added on demand.
- **Automation-friendly tooling.** Every workflow is scriptable and available as
  a library, making Skaff easy to embed in CI or internal developer platforms.

## Components at a glance

| Surface                                            | Role                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLI (`apps/cli`)**                               | Primary interface for project creation, diff preparation, and automation. Published on npm, Bun, and as standalone binaries. |
| **Web app (`apps/web`)**                           | Next.js dashboard with schema-driven forms, diff previews, and project management for teams that prefer a GUI.               |
| **Core runtime (`packages/skaff-lib`)**            | Shared rendering and diffing engine consumed by the CLI, web app, and custom integrations.                                   |
| **Template types (`packages/template-types-lib`)** | Typed helpers for `templateConfig.ts` files, subtemplate wiring, migrations, and side effects.                               |

## How Skaff stays reproducible

- Template code runs in a hardened SES sandbox with a strict allow-list of
  imports.
- Template outputs are rendered in a temporary Git repo and surfaced as diffs or
  patches, so you can always review changes before applying them.
- `templateSettings.json` captures template inputs and instance metadata, making
  updates deterministic.
