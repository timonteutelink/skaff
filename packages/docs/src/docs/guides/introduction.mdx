Skaff is a TypeScript-powered scaffolding toolkit that turns curated templates into ready-to-run projects.
It combines a fast CLI, a web dashboard, and shared libraries so teams can ship consistent services without copying stale boilerplates.

## What you get

- **Guided project creation.** Render templates from the CLI or web UI, validate answers with Zod, and review a Git diff before anything touches your repository.
- **Repeatable upgrades.** Save template settings once and rerun the template later to generate patch files that capture only upstream changes.
- **Composable features.** Break large starters into subtemplates so optional modules, jobs, or stacks can be added on demand.
- **Automation-friendly tooling.** Every workflow is scriptable and available as a library, making Skaff easy to embed in CI or internal developer platforms.

## Components at a glance

| Surface                                            | Role                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLI (`apps/cli`)**                               | Primary interface for project creation, diff preparation, and automation. Published on npm, Bun, and as standalone binaries. |
| **Web app (`apps/web`)**                           | Next.js dashboard with schema-driven forms, diff previews, and project management for teams that prefer a GUI.               |
| **Core runtime (`packages/skaff-lib`)**            | Shared rendering and diffing engine consumed by the CLI, web app, and custom integrations.                                   |
| **Template types (`packages/template-types-lib`)** | Typed helpers for `templateConfig.ts` files, subtemplate wiring, migrations, and side effects.                               |
