Explore the [`example-templates`](https://github.com/timonteutelink/example-templates)
repository for ready-made scenarios you can clone or adapt. Each template
includes a `templateConfig.ts` file plus a `templates/` directory, making it a
practical reference for structure, settings schemas, and subtemplate layouts.

Use these templates as blueprints when crafting your own repositories and pair
them with the [template authoring](./authoring/index) guides for deeper
explanation.
