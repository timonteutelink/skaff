title: Getting Started
---

Welcome aboard! This guide will walk you through installing Code Templator and generating your **first project** in just a few minutes. By the end, youâ€™ll have a new project scaffolded from a template and an understanding of the basic workflow.

## Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (>= 18) or **Bun** (>= 1.2) â€“ Code Templator is written in TypeScript and runs on Node. We recommend Node 18+ or the latest Bun for best results.
* **Git** â€“ Make sure you have Git installed and on your systemâ€™s PATH. Code Templator uses Git for version control of templates and for applying patches.

## 1. Install the CLI

The quickest way to get started is with the command-line tool. You can install it globally via npm (or Yarn/Pnpm) or use it via npx without global install.

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install -g @timonteutelink/skaff-cli
```

**Using Bun:**

```bash
bun add -g @timonteutelink/skaff-cli
```

> **Note:** The CLI is distributed under the name `skaff` (scoped in npm as `@timonteutelink/skaff-cli`). After installation, you should be able to run `skaff --help` to verify itâ€™s on your PATH.

If you prefer not to install globally, you can invoke the CLI with `npx` whenever you need it:

```bash
npx @timonteutelink/skaff-cli --help
```

This will download and run the CLI temporarily. You can prepend `npx` to any of the commands shown in the docs if you choose not to install the tool globally.

## 2. (Optional) Configure Template Sources

**If** your CLI installation comes with a default set of example templates, you can skip this step for now. By default, Code Templator looks in its configuration for template repositories. If you want to use your own templates or the official example templates repository, youâ€™ll need to tell Code Templator where to find them.

For first-time use, we recommend using our **official example templates** to have some templates to play with. You can get them by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff-example-templates.git
```

Suppose you cloned it to `~/skaff-templates`. Now letâ€™s register this path in Code Templatorâ€™s config so the CLI knows about these templates:

```bash
skaff config add ~/skaff-templates templatePaths
```

This adds your local templates repository to the search paths. You can add multiple paths (for example, if your company maintains its own template repo, add that path too). To verify templates are recognized, run:

```bash
skaff template default
```

This should list all **root templates** available (top-level templates) from the added repositories. If you see a list of template names (like `next-api`, `react-app`, `helm-chart`, etc.), youâ€™re ready to go!

*If no templates show up*, double-check that you ran the `config add` command with the correct path. You can run `skaff config get` to see current settings. By default, `templatePaths` might be empty until you add one.

> **Tip:** The config file is stored at `~/.config/skaff/config.json`. In addition to `templatePaths`, it may contain other settings (like preferred diff viewer tool, package manager preferences, etc.). You typically wonâ€™t need to edit this by hand â€“ use the `skaff config` commands.

## 3. Generate a New Project

Now for the fun part â€“ creating your first project! Weâ€™ll use a **Next.js API** template as an example (it creates a minimal Next.js project with a single API route).

Run the following command:

```bash
skaff project new my-api next-api
```

Here:

* `my-api` will be the name of the new project (and folder).
* `next-api` is the name of the template we want to use.

If this is the first time youâ€™re using a particular template, the CLI might take a moment to load it (cloning the template repository or reading it from disk). Then it will prompt you for any template-specific settings. For our example, you might be asked:

* **Project description** (for the README and package.json)
* **License type** (maybe MIT vs Apache, depending on the template)
* etc.

Each prompt will have a default or example. Fill them in or accept defaults.

Once you answer the prompts, Code Templator will generate the project. Youâ€™ll see log messages as it creates files and sets up the git repo. If everything goes well, you should see a success message with the path of your new project.

**Navigate into the project directory**:

```bash
cd my-api
```

Youâ€™ll find all the files the template generated. For a Next.js API template, that might include:

* `pages/api/hello.ts` â€“ an example API route.
* `package.json` â€“ with dependencies and scripts (perhaps a dev script to run Next).
* `tsconfig.json`, `eslint config`, etc. â€“ common configuration files.
* `templateSettings.json` â€“ this file tracks the template details (you can peek at it to see whatâ€™s recorded, but you usually wonâ€™t edit it manually).

Now try running the project to confirm it works. For a Next.js project, youâ€™d run the development server. If youâ€™re using **Bun**, maybe the template has a `bun dev` script; with npm, `npm run dev`. For example:

```bash
bun dev
```

This should start the Next.js dev server, and you can visit the provided URL (often `http://localhost:3000/api/hello` for an API route) to see the "Hello World" response. ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™ve just scaffolded and run a project in a couple of commands!

## 4. Explore the Project

Open the project in your code editor. Youâ€™ll see all the boilerplate that was created. Take a look at some key files:

* **README.md** â€“ Many templates include a README with template-specific info or next steps.
* **templateSettings.json** â€“ As mentioned, this JSON tracks the template name, the exact template commit used, and all your input values. This is how Code Templator knows how to update your project later.
* **.github/workflows/** â€“ If the template set up a CI pipeline (common in many templates), youâ€™ll find GitHub Actions workflows here ready to go.
* **Any feature files** â€“ e.g., in a web app template, check if thereâ€™s a Dockerfile (if you enabled a Docker subtemplate), or in our Next.js API, see the simple API route that was created.

The project is yours to modify as you wish. Commit your changes as normal. You donâ€™t need to (and shouldnâ€™t) commit the `templateSettings.json` to a public repo if your project is public, since itâ€™s mainly for your tooling â€“ but itâ€™s fine to keep it in private repos. (It doesnâ€™t contain secrets, just metadata.)

## 5. (Optional) Using the Web UI

Everything we did with the CLI can also be done in the Web UI if you prefer a graphical approach. The Web UI lets you select a template, fill out a form for the inputs (with nice descriptions and defaults), and then generate the project â€“ plus you can preview the file diff beforehand.

If youâ€™d like to try it:

* Ensure you have the Code Templator repo cloned (or at least the web app part). If you installed via npm, you can instead use our Docker image.
* Follow the guide in **Using the Web Interface** (next section of the docs) to start the web app.

This can be a gentler introduction for those who dislike CLI prompts.

## 6. Next Steps

Congratulations on generating your first project! From here, you can:

* **Add Features:** Try adding a subtemplate to your project if one is available. For instance, if thereâ€™s a subtemplate for adding a new component or enabling a feature, use the CLI or Web UI to apply it. This will show you how Code Templator manages incremental changes.
* **Update the Template:** If the template gets updated (you pull a newer version of the template repo), try running an update on your project. Use `skaff project diff prepare-update <newTemplateCommit>` to see the changes.
* **Create Your Own Template:** Thatâ€™s the ultimate power â€“ you can write templates tailored to your needs. Head over to the **Template Authoring Guide** to learn how to create a template config, use Handlebars, define subtemplates, etc. Start with something simple like a README and expand from there.
* **Read the CLI Reference:** For a full list of CLI commands (like cloning an existing project, listing templates, etc.), see the CLI reference documentation.
