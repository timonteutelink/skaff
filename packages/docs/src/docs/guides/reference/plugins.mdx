Skaff plugins extend template generation, CLI workflows, and the web interface.
Templates opt in via the `plugins` array in `templateConfig.ts`, and Skaff
activates only **pre-registered** plugins.

## Installation surfaces

| Environment | Installation method | Notes |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| **CLI** | `skaff plugins install <package>` | Uses oclif's plugin system. Required for template plugins and CLI-only plugins. |
| **Web (Docker)** | `SKAFF_PLUGINS` build argument | Plugins are bundled at build time; runtime installs are not supported. |
| **Web (Nix)** | `plugins` parameter | Nix builds inject plugin packages into the build. |
| **Library** | npm dependency + `registerPluginModules` | Programmatic use in custom tooling. |

Templates requiring missing plugins remain visible but disabled, with a message
showing which plugins or versions are missing.

## Trust levels

Skaff assigns a trust level to each plugin package:

| Trust Level | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **official** | From `@skaff/*` or `@timonteutelink/*` scopes, maintained by the Skaff team. |
| **verified** | Published with npm provenance linking to a source repository. |
| **community** | Standard npm package without provenance verification. |
| **private** | From a private registry (your organization owns the trust decision). |
| **unknown** | Trust could not be determined. |

The CLI and web UI warn when installing or using non-official plugins. These
warnings are informational—they do not block installation.

## Compatibility rules

- Templates can specify a semver range for each plugin. Skaff checks the range
  against installed versions.
- When multiple plugins are required, ordering is controlled by `dependsOn` and
  `weight` hints.
- Plugins can be split by surface area (e.g. base generation, CLI commands, web
  UI stages) so templates depend only on the pieces they need.

## Where plugin input lives

Plugin input is stored in `templateSettings.json` under each instance’s
`templateSettings.plugins` object. Plugin output is recomputed at generation
and diff time to keep outputs deterministic.
