Skaff stores project state in `templateSettings.json` at the project root. This
file tracks the templates that have been instantiated and their input settings.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `projectRepositoryName` | Project name used when the root template was instantiated. |
| `projectAuthor` | Author or team string captured at instantiation. |
| `rootTemplateName` | Name of the root template used to create the project. |
| `instantiatedTemplates` | Array of template instance records. |

## Template instance fields

Each entry in `instantiatedTemplates` includes:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `id` | Instance ID (`root` for the root template). |
| `parentId` | Parent instance ID for subtemplates (optional). |
| `templateName` | Template name on disk. |
| `templateSettings` | User-provided settings, including plugin input under `plugins`. |
| `templateCommitHash` | Commit hash the template was rendered from (optional). |
| `templateRepoUrl` | Repository URL for the template (optional). |
| `templateBranch` | Branch name used when instantiating (optional). |
| `automaticallyInstantiatedByParent` | Whether a parent template auto-added this instance. |
| `lastMigration` | UUID of the last applied migration (optional). |

## Plugin input

Plugin input is stored under `templateSettings.plugins` to keep generation
bijective. Plugin output is recalculated at generation time and is not stored in
`templateSettings.json`.
