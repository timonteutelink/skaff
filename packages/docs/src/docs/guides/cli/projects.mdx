Projects track which templates ran, the revision used, and the settings that
were supplied. The commands below cover the full lifecycle.

## Create a project

```bash
skaff project new my-service fastapi \
  --repo github:timonteutelink/example-templates \
  --settings ./settings.json   # optional inline JSON or path
```

If `--settings` is omitted, Skaff prompts for values derived from the template’s
Zod schema. When the command finishes it opens a diff for review. Accept the
patch to write files to disk.

Useful helpers:

- `skaff project from-settings <path>` replays a stored `templateSettings.json`.
- `skaff project ls --format table` lists projects discovered under
  `PROJECT_SEARCH_PATHS`.
- `skaff project show` prints the active template tree for the current project.
- `skaff project clone <new-name> <existing-path>` generates a new repository
  from an existing Skaff project.

## Add or edit subtemplates

Subtemplates let you add optional modules or repeatable slices later in the
project lifecycle.

```bash
skaff project add-subtemplate <parentId> <templateName> <subtemplateName> \
  --settings ./feature.json
```

Retrieve instance IDs from `templateSettings.json`. To modify an instance, run
`skaff project modify <instanceId>` or prepare a diff with
`skaff project diff prepare-modification <instanceId>`.

## Prepare updates and diffs

Keep projects aligned with upstream template changes by rendering diffs against a
newer revision:

```bash
skaff project update main --apply
# or for manual control
skaff project diff prepare-update main --format json
skaff project diff apply <diff-hash>
```

Other diff helpers include:

- `skaff project diff prepare-instantiation` for subtemplate additions.
- `skaff project diff diff-from-template` to compare a project with its original
  template revision.
- `skaff git diff-template` to show a summarized diff table.

## Run template commands

Templates can surface useful commands (tests, dev servers, etc.). Execute them
with:

```bash
skaff project run --instance root --command "Run tests"
```

Use the command title defined in the template’s `commands` list.

## Remove a project

```bash
skaff project delete /path/to/project
```

This deletes the project repository on disk. Use with care.
