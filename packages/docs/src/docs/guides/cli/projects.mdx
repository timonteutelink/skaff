Projects track which templates ran, the revision used, and the settings that were supplied. The commands below cover the full lifecycle.

## Create a project

```bash
skaff project new my-service fastapi \
  --repo github:timonteutelink/example-templates \
  --settings ./settings.json   # optional inline JSON or path
```

If `--settings` is omitted, Skaff prompts for values derived from the templateâ€™s Zod schema. When the command finishes it opens a diff for review. Accept the patch to write files to disk.

Useful helpers:

- `skaff project from-settings <path>` replays a stored `templateSettings.json`.
- `skaff project ls --format table` lists all Skaff projects in configured search paths.
- `skaff project show` prints the active template tree for the current project.

## Add or edit subtemplates

Subtemplates let you add optional modules or repeatable slices later in the project lifecycle.

```bash
skaff project add-subtemplate <parentId> <templateName> <subtemplateName> \
  --settings ./feature.json
```

Retrieve instance IDs from `templateSettings.json`. To modify an instance, run `skaff project modify <instanceId>` or prepare a diff with `skaff project diff prepare-modification <instanceId>`.

## Prepare updates

Keep projects aligned with upstream template changes by rendering a diff against a newer revision:

```bash
skaff project update main            # branch, tag, or commit SHA
# or for manual control
diffHash=$(skaff project diff prepare-update main --format json | jq -r '.diffHash')
skaff project diff apply "$diffHash"
```

Resolve conflicts with your normal Git workflow. Skaff only touches files that belong to the template instance being updated.
