The CLI is the fastest way to script Skaff workflows. Global flags include `--format (json|ndjson|tsv|table)` for machine-readable output and `--help` on every command.

Use the guides below to manage configuration, projects, and automation:

- [Configure Skaff](./cli/setup) — keep template sources and settings in sync.
- [Work with projects](./cli/projects) — generate projects, manage subtemplates, and prepare update diffs.
- [Automate the CLI](./cli/automation) — embed Skaff in CI/CD or other scripted environments.

Need exhaustive flags? Jump to the [CLI reference](./reference/cli).
