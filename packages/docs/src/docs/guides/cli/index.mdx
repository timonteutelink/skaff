The CLI is the fastest way to script Skaff workflows. Global flags include
`--format (json|ndjson|tsv|table)` for machine-readable output, `--project` to
pin a project directory, and `--dev-templates` to relax template repository
checks when iterating locally.

Use the guides below to manage configuration, templates, projects, and
automation:

- [Configure Skaff](./setup) — keep template sources and settings in sync.
- [Work with templates](./templates) — load, inspect, and refresh repositories.
- [Work with projects](./projects) — generate projects, manage subtemplates, and
  prepare update diffs.
- [Git helpers](./git-tools) — compare a project with its stored template
  revision.
- [Automate the CLI](./automation) — embed Skaff in CI/CD or other scripted
  environments.
- [Manage plugins](./plugins) — install, list, and run plugin-provided commands.
