Skaff includes git-aware helpers for comparing a project with its template
revision.

## Compare project to its template

```bash
skaff git diff-template
```

This command shows a summarized diff table between the current project and the
template revision stored in `templateSettings.json`. Use `--project <path>` to
point at a different project directory.
