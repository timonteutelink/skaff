The web app wraps Skaff’s templating engine in a Next.js dashboard. Use it for demos, collaborative reviews, or when a form-driven workflow beats terminal prompts.

## Run the app

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/.config/skaff:/app/.config/skaff \
  -v ~/.cache/skaff:/app/.cache/skaff \
  -v ~/projects:/projects \
  timonteutelink/skaff-web:latest
```

Mount the config and cache directories so the web app reads the same settings and repositories as the CLI. Bind any project folders you want to edit into `/projects`.

### Local development

```bash
bun install
bun --filter apps/web dev
```

The dev server listens on port 3000 and hot reloads as you edit the interface.

## Use the workflow

1. **Select a template.** The Templates view lists every root template available via your configuration and lets you load new Git repositories on demand with the “Load from Github” action.
2. **Fill in the form.** Fields and validation rules are derived from the template’s Zod schema.
3. **Preview the diff.** Inspect new files, edits, and removals before applying changes.
4. **Generate files.** Choose a destination directory and apply the patch. Skaff updates `templateSettings.json` automatically.

Return later to add subtemplates, apply template updates, or run template-defined commands directly from the browser. Reference the [project README](https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff#readme) for environment variables, release processes, and repository structure.

## Troubleshooting

- Templates not showing up? Verify the mount paths inside the container and ensure repositories are accessible.
- Seeing stale content? Clear cached repositories with `skaff template erase-cache` and reload the app.
- Patch failures? Resolve conflicts in your editor, then retry the action—the UI surfaces detailed errors in toast notifications.
