Use these short guides to install Skaff, run your first template, and learn the
core ideas that power every workflow:

- [CLI quickstart](./cli-quickstart) — install the CLI, register template
  sources, and scaffold a sample project.
- [Web quickstart](./web-quickstart) — launch the web interface with Docker or
  from source and generate a project from the browser.
- [Core concepts](./core-concepts) — understand templates, stored settings, and
  how diffs keep generated projects upgradeable.
