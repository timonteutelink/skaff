Prefer a graphical workflow? Launch the Skaff web app and create a project from
the browser.

## 1. Start the web app

Choose the option that matches your environment:

### Docker (fastest)

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/.config/skaff:/app/.config/skaff \
  -v ~/.cache/skaff:/app/.cache/skaff \
  -v ~/projects:/projects \
  timonteutelink/skaff:latest
```

Mounting your config and cache directories keeps the web app aligned with the
CLI, and the `/projects` bind mount exposes a workspace for generated files.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) once the container starts.

### From source

```bash
bun install
bun --filter apps/web dev
```

The dev server runs on port 3000 and uses your local
`~/.config/skaff/settings.json`.

## 2. Confirm template access

Use the CLI or the **Templates** view’s “Load from GitHub” action to add
repositories. Both surfaces update the same configuration file, so changes are
shared instantly.

## 3. Generate a project visually

1. Pick a template from the library to open its generated form.
2. Complete required and optional fields. Validation hints appear inline.
3. Click **Preview diff** to inspect every change.
4. Choose a destination folder and click **Generate** to write the files.

Return to the UI later to apply template updates, add subtemplates, or run
template-defined commands. For details on plugin support and advanced
workflows, see the [web app guide](../web/index).
