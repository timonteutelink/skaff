Author templates to encode your organisation’s standards. Each template couples TypeScript metadata with a file tree that Skaff renders into projects. These guides cover the lifecycle from structure to maintenance:

- [Design the workflow](./workflow) — lay out directories, schemas, and subtemplates.
- [Use advanced APIs](./advanced) — tap into hooks for side effects, migrations, and command hints.
- [Maintain and share templates](./maintenance) — keep templates reliable over time.

For full type definitions, reference the [TemplateConfig API](../reference/template-config).
