Once the basics are in place, extend templates with the hooks below. Every API
is fully typed through `@timonteutelink/template-types-lib`.

| API                            | Use it for                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mapFinalSettings`             | Derive values after validation. Receives `{ projectContext, templateSettings, parentSettings }`.                                                  |
| `redirects`                    | Move rendered files to dynamic destinations (for example, namespaced feature folders).                                                            |
| `allowedOverwrites`            | Explicitly permit overwriting existing files. Use sparingly—prefer targeted side effects when possible.                                           |
| `sideEffects`                  | Programmatically edit files that already exist. Supply `{ filePath, transform }` entries that return updated contents. Keep functions idempotent. |
| `autoInstantiatedSubtemplates` | Add child templates automatically based on parent settings.                                                                                        |
| `commands`                     | Surface helpful commands (test, lint, launch) in the CLI and web UI after generation.                                                             |
| `migrations`                   | Upgrade stored settings when schemas change. Each migration has a UUID and can depend on a predecessor.                                           |
| `templatesThatDisableThis`     | Prevent incompatible template combinations based on existing instances and settings.                                                              |
| `assertions`                   | Fail generation early if required preconditions are not met.                                                                                      |
| `handlebarHelpers`             | Register extra Handlebars helpers for templated files.                                                                                            |
| `possibleParentTemplates`      | Declare which parent templates may host this template as a detached subtree, especially across repositories.                                      |

signatures and additional helpers.
