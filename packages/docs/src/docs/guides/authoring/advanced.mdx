Once the basics are in place, extend templates with the hooks below. Every API is fully typed through `@timonteutelink/template-types-lib`.

| API                                             | Use it for                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mapFinalSettings`                              | Derive values after validation. Ideal for generating slugs, composing booleans, or backfilling defaults.                                      |
| `redirects`                                     | Move rendered files to dynamic destinations (for example, namespaced feature folders).                                                        |
| `allowedOverwrites`                             | Explicitly permit overwriting existing files. Use sparinglyâ€”prefer targeted side effects when possible.                                       |
| `sideEffects`                                   | Programmatically edit files that already exist. Supply `{ filePath, apply }` entries that return updated contents. Keep functions idempotent. |
| `autoInstantiatedSubtemplates`                  | Add child templates automatically based on parent settings. Supports async callbacks for lookup logic.                                        |
| `commands`                                      | Surface helpful commands (test, lint, launch) in the CLI and web UI after generation.                                                         |
| `migrations`                                    | Upgrade stored settings when schemas change. Each migration has a UUID and can depend on a predecessor.                                       |
| `aiAutoGenerate` / `aiUserConversationSettings` | Optional helpers for LLM-assisted scaffolding. Always provide manual fallbacks for accessibility.                                             |
