Treat templates like production code so consumers can trust them.

- **Document options.** Add a README next to each root template describing required inputs, available subtemplates, and sample commands.
- **Test rendered projects.** Run language-specific tests or smoke scripts after template changes to ensure outputs still build.
- **Tag releases.** Create Git tags when major updates ship. Skaff stores commit hashes, but readable tags make diffs easier to track.
- **Bundle examples.** Check in representative `templateSettings.json` files to demonstrate common scenarios. Users can feed them to `skaff project from-settings`.
- **Review side effects.** Keep `sideEffects` deterministic and idempotent to avoid noisy diffs on repeated runs.
- **Distribute accessibly.** Host repositories where your teams can reach themâ€”private organisation Git, public GitHub, or archives referenced from the [main README](https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff#readme).
