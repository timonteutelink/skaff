Thanks for helping improve Skaff! The monorepo hosts the CLI, web app, shared libraries, and documentation. Start by reading the [project README](https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff#readme) for installation commands and release context.

## Local setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies: `bun install`.
2. Build shared packages so apps have fresh artefacts: `bun run turbo run build`.
3. Run formatters and tests before committing: `bun run format` and `bun test` (or package-level scripts).
4. Work on a feature branch and open a pull request against `main` once checks pass.

Use `bun --filter apps/cli dev` or `bun --filter apps/web dev` when you need live reload for those surfaces.

## Documentation changes

Docs live under `packages/docs`. Preview them locally with:

```bash
cd packages/docs
bun install
bun run dev
```

Keep pages concise, prefer task-oriented headings, and run `bunx prettier --check "packages/docs/src/**/*.mdx"` before committing.

## Release overview

Maintainers coordinate releases when features land:

1. Merge changes into `main` with passing CI.
2. Bump versions across packages and tag the release (e.g. `v0.x.y`).
3. GitHub Actions publishes npm packages, CLI binaries, the Docker image, and the updated docs site.

Discuss patch releases or larger roadmap topics in GitHub Discussions or Discord.
