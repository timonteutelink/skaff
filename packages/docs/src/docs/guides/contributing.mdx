Thanks for helping improve Skaff! The monorepo hosts the CLI, web app, shared
libraries, and documentation. Start with the
[project README](https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff#readme) for release
context and high-level setup.

## Local setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies: `bun install`.
2. Build shared packages so apps have fresh artefacts:
   `bun run turbo run build`.
3. Run formatters and tests before committing:
   - `bun run format`
   - `cd packages/skaff-lib && bun run test`
4. Work on a feature branch and open a pull request against `main` once checks
   pass.

Run the CLI against local sources with `node apps/cli/bin/dev.js <command>` and
launch the web UI with `bun --filter apps/web dev` when you need live reload.

## Documentation changes

Docs live under `packages/docs`. Preview them locally with:

```bash
cd packages/docs
bun install
bun run dev
```

Keep pages concise, prefer task-oriented headings, and run
`bunx prettier --check "packages/docs/src/**/*.mdx"` before committing.

## Release overview

Maintainers coordinate releases when features land:

1. Merge changes into `main` with passing CI.
2. Bump versions across packages and tag the release (for example, `v0.x.y`).
3. GitHub Actions publishes npm packages, CLI binaries, the Docker image, and
   the updated docs site.

Discuss patch releases or larger roadmap topics in GitHub Discussions or
Discord.
