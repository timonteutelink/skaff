Welcome to the auto-generated command manual for the Skaff CLI. Each page in this section is created from the published binary so the flags and examples always match the current release.

- New to the CLI? Start with the [workflow guides](/docs/cli/) for installation, project creation, and automation patterns.
- Prefer a broader project overview? Keep the [repository README](https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff#readme) handy while you browse the commands.
