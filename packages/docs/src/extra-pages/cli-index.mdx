title: Skaff CLI reference
---

Welcome to the auto-generated command manual for the Skaff CLI. Each page in
this section is created from the published binary so the flags and examples
match the current release.

- New to the CLI? Start with the [CLI quickstart](/docs/basics/cli-quickstart)
  and the [workflow guides](/docs/cli/index).
- Prefer a broader project overview? Keep the
  [repository README](https://github.com/timonteutelink/skaff#readme) handy while
  you browse the commands.
